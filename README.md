Formula to help you make cool responsive websites

### üìú A little about how this formula was developed and what it is for:
I honestly admit that adaptive websites are a sore subject for me, and I don't really like doing it. Because it is long and difficult. Therefore, I am constantly on the lookout for something that would simplify this task. You can say there is Bootstrap and you are right. But it's worth remembering how many layouts are used in it. If I‚Äôm not mistaken, it‚Äôs about five, and the last one already stretches across the entire width. Now let's remember the reality where we are given only 3 different layout options at best, and at worst only two. Therefore, we have to somehow get out and come up with something. This formula, which I developed, is that when the screen shrinks, the blocks will be at the end of the dimensions that you specify in the formula. Yes, this does not solve the issue of using media queries, but I did not say that this is a solution for all occasions. This is just a help in implementing responsive design, nothing more.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How the reduction formula works and what it consists of:

```
(100vw - var(--responsive-layout-1)) / ((var(--desktop-layout) - var(--responsive-layout-2)) / (var(--desktop-size-1) - var(--mobile-size-1))) + var(--mobile-size-2)
```

1. `desktop-layout` - in this variable we specify the size of our container on the desktop (for example: 768px)
2. `responsive-layout-1` - in this variable we specify the size of the container to which the compression will occur (for example: 320px) (IMPORTANT! In this variable, we specify the value strictly with the units of measurement (this is possible - 320px, and so - 320 is not possible))
3. `responsive-layout-2` - in this variable we specify the same value as in `responsive-layout-1`, but without px this is important
4. `desktop-size-1` - in this variable we indicate what size of the font or block on the desktop version (example: 80) (IMPORTANT! Here we indicate the value without units of measurement)
5. `desktop-size-2` - this variable is not used in the formula, but we will need it later in the font-size property (example: 80px) (IMPORTANT! Here we specify the value with a unit of measurement)
6. `mobile-size-1` - in this variable we indicate the size of the font or block on the mobile version (example: 15) (IMPORTANT! Here we indicate the value without units of measurement)
7. `mobile-size-2` - in this variable we also indicate the value of the font or block on the mobile version, but with the units of measurement (example: 15px)

### üõ† General record to be used in development:

```
.box {
  /* Responsive font-size */
  --desktop-layout: 1600;
  --responsive-layout-1: 320px;
  --responsive-layout-2: 320;
  --desktop-size-1: 80;
  --desktop-size-2: 80px;
  --mobile-size-1: 15;
  --mobile-size-2: 15px;
  --responsive-size: (100vw - var(--responsive-layout-1)) / ((var(--desktop-layout) - var(--responsive-layout-2)) / (var(--desktop-size-1) - var(--mobile-size-1))) + var(--mobile-size-2);
  font-size: clamp(var(--mobile-size-2), var(--responsive-size), var(--desktop-size-2));
}
```

### ‚ùóÔ∏è ATTENTION:

- This formula works, as in the desktop-first approach, and in the mobile-first approach, the formula does not change from this. The only thing you need is not only one layout option, but at least two (initial and final). Because in the formula you write two values, which is logical from and to
- In the description, I mainly mentioned font size, but in fact, this formula applies to anything that will change sizes. For example, the width and height of a button or block of some kind. There is no difference, it's just that I mostly use it for font size and padding.
- Also, in this formula, other units of measurement are allowed instead of px. You can use em, rem,% whatever you like. There are no restrictions here.
- The last thing to remember is that this formula does not work for magnification. Those. from small to large it will not do. Those. Let's say the font size on a desktop is 16px, but on a mobile device 30px the formula will not work unfortunately. Such cases are rare, but they exist. In the future I will release an update and add another such formula just in case.
- An important point if you want to use this formula for many css properties at once, look in the `responsive.css` file there I prepared different variants of variables for the main properties.
